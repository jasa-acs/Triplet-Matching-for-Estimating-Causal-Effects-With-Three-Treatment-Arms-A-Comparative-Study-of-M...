## Data

### Abstract

We considered 5 years of data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), from 2006 to 2010. The NEDS is a national representative dataset designed by the Agency for Healthcare Research Quality to enable analyses of emergency department (ED) utilization patterns. We selected trauma patients using the National Trauma Data Standard Patient Inclusion Criteria as definition. We restricted our analysis to adults aged 18-64.



### Availability 

The distribution of the NEDS database is regulated by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization project (HCUP) Central Distributor. The data are available for purchase and all the HCUP users must sign the Data Use Agreement form and complete an online training. 

### Description 

We are not allowed to distribute the NEDS data

## Code

### Abstract

Analysis were run using R. All the code used for the analysis will be made as online supplement to the paper.

### Description

All of the results have been produced with R, version 3.5. The code to reproduce all the results will be made available as online supplement. The code will allow to implement the matching algorithm described in the paper and to reproduce the simulation analyses. We will also make available the code used to analyze the NEDS dataset and to implement the sensitivity analysis to hidden bias. 
The code will be released with MIT License


### Optional Information 

The analyses have been run on a simple laptop PC (operating system: Microsoft Windows 10 Home Edition, processor: Intel Core i3 2.13 GHz). 
The implementation of the three-way matching algorithm has been based on the two-way optimal matching implemented in the “optmatch” package, version 0.9.10.



## Instructions for Use

### Reproducibility 

We will upload the code implementing the part of the paper reproducible without access to the NEDS dataset, that is, the simulation analysis for the matching algorithm. We will provide the code that we have used to analyze the NEDS data. This will allow readers to reproduce analogous outcome analysis and the sensitivity analysis to hidden bias on different datasets. 
### Notes
Applications to purchase the NEDS database are regulated by the HCUP Central distributor. The data are provided under the condition that all the data user have completed the HCUP Data Use Agreement Training Tool and signed the Data Use Agreement. 

Further information can be found in the NEDS section of the HCUP website.
